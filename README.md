# Data-Science
This documents contains description of two data structures which include Tuples and stacks

## Stacks
It is a linear data structure that follows a particular order in which the operations are perfomed.The order may be (last in first out)
or (first in last out), this implies that the element inserted last comes out first and (Filo) implies that the elemnt inserted first comes out last.
Stacks are used for evaluating epression consisting of operands and operators.
Stacks are used for backtracking ie checking paranthesis matching in an expression.
Stacks are used to convert one form of expression to another form.

## Tuples
It is a data structure that contains an ordered collection of elements.
Tuples are indexed orderd and contain duplicate values.
A tuple is used as a paranthesis checker and it is used to insert records in database.

## Queues.
It is a linear data sructure that consists of collection of items that follows a first in first out sequence.
Queues can be acessed on both end and can handle  multiple data.
